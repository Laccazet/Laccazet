<h2 align="left">About me</h2>

###

<p align="left">I have always been interested in computers since I was a child. I've always been fascinated by how they work, the connection between software and hardware. I started writing my own code in C# in high school. I learned the basics of coding with simple projects. So far, I have used Python and C++ languages ​​from time to time. C++ showed me the power of coding. The most important thing that connected me to coding in this coding adventure was the endless learning cycle. Learning new things without stopping make me extremely happy and motivate me. Now I am using React and I have started to learn frameworks such as Electron, Three.js. I am very happy that the pleasure of learning never ends on this journey.</p>
